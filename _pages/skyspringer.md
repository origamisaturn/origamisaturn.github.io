# SkySpringer Model Airplane

This is a CAD model (and build) based on the plans of the [SkySpringer by Clark Salisbury](https://www.modelaviation.com/clark-salisbury-skyspringer).

I made the CAD model from June to August of 2021, and built the plane sometime in late 2022. I wanted to build and fly a wooden model aircraft from plans. I used this project to learn SolidWorks and create a CAD assembly for the aircraft. I took a bottom-up approach, modelling individual parts as indicated on the plans from the Model Aviation site. I created sub-assemblies for the fuselage, wing, horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer, and a final assembly from all of the sub assemblies.

I then used the CAD assembly to generate files for laser-cutting the balsa sheets. More complex parts, like the wooden wingtips and the landing gear struts, were 3D-printed instead of being manually sanded down from wooden blocks or cut from sheet metal. The lifting surfaces were covered with iron-on sheet, and the aircraft was rigged for 3ch RC flight.
